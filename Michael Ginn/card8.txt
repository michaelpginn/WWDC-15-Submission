    Unpacking History: The Interwar Period was the result of an assignment from my history teacher, to make a timeline in "a creative way".  The app was created in a single day over about five hours.  While not a complex app, it uses a clean design and fulfills its function well.  The project was also my first experience with reading data from a text file, a useful skill that I have used in the project as well.
