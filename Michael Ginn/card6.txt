Stuff I do
    I participate in many different activities.  I currently play volleyball, both for my school and a club.  I sing in an advanced school choir as well as for my local church.  I act in my school's annual play and musical.  I hold a leadership role in Boy Scouts, and am running for webmaster of my school's Latin club.  I play piano, guitar, and ukulele.
