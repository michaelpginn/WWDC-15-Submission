# WWDC-15-Submission
My (accepted) submission for the WWDC 2015 Student Scholarship

In 2015, the prompt for WWDC was to create an app that tells the users about you. I, then a spry 14-year old, designed this app where you collect cards with different bits of information about myself. When you have collected all the cards, you were rewarded with a special picture.

### Important Note
I tried to preserve the repository as much as possible in its original state. However, I had to make a few changes now (2020). These were:
- I added back in files that were missing and fixed references
- I fixed IBActions and IBOutlets that were broken as a result of changing naming conventions
- I updated `prepareForSegue` and similar methods to use the new method signature, so their functionality would still work.

Other than that, the repository is the exact code that I submitted!
